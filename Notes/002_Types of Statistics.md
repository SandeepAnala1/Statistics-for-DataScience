# Types of Statistics
### 1) Descriptive Statistics
**Definition:** Descriptive statistics involve summarizing and organizing data so that it can be easily understood. This includes measures like averages, medians, modes, variances, and visual representations like graphs and charts.

**Examples:**
1. **What is the average height of students in this classroom?**
   - *Type:* Descriptive
   - *Explanation:* This question seeks to summarize the data by finding the average height, which provides a simple overview of the data.

2. **How many students scored above 90 in the last exam?**
   - *Type:* Descriptive
   - *Explanation:* This question involves counting the number of students who achieved a certain score, summarizing the performance of the class.

3. **What is the distribution of grades in the class?**
   - *Type:* Descriptive
   - *Explanation:* This question involves creating a frequency distribution to see how grades are spread out among students.

### 2) Inferential Statistics
**Definition:** Inferential statistics involve using data from a sample to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population. This includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.

**Examples:**
1. **Do the marks of students in this classroom reflect the marks of all students in the school?**
   - *Type:* Inferential
   - *Explanation:* This question involves taking a sample (classroom marks) and making a generalization or inference about a larger population (school marks).

2. **Is there a significant difference in the average scores between students who attend tutoring sessions and those who do not?**
   - *Type:* Inferential
   - *Explanation:* This question involves comparing two groups and determining if the observed difference is statistically significant.

3. **Can we predict the final exam scores based on the number of hours studied per week?**
   - *Type:* Inferential
   - *Explanation:* This question involves using regression analysis to make predictions about exam scores based on study hours.
