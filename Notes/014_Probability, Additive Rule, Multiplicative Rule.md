# Probability
Probability is a measure of likelyhood of an event.
Eg: Ah, Roll a dice {1,2,3,4,5,6}. What is a probability of getting a 6

### Key Concepts:
1. **Sample Space (S):** The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
2. **Event (A):** A subset of the sample space. It is the outcome or a set of outcomes we are interested in.

# Addition Rule(Probability,'Or')
## Mutual Exclusive Event
Two events are mutual exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time
Eg: Rolling a dice {1,2,3,4,5,6} Here we just get only one number, but not two or three at at time

## Non Mutual Exclusive Event
Multiple events can occur at the same time
Eg: Deck of Cards {King, Heart}

### Example 1 for Mutually Exclusive
When you toss a coin, there are two possible outcomes: landing on heads or landing on tails. These outcomes are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot happen at the same time. 

To find the probability of either of these mutually exclusive events occurring, you can use the following formula:

So, the probability of the coin landing on heads or tails is 1, meaning it is certain that the coin will land on either heads or tails.

### Example 1 for Non Mutual Exclusive
To solve the problem of finding the probability of choosing a card that is either a queen or a heart from a standard deck of 52 cards, we need to use the formula for non-mutually exclusive events. Non-mutually exclusive events can occur simultaneously. 

In a deck of 52 cards:
- There are 4 queens.
- There are 13 hearts.
- There is 1 queen of hearts, which is counted in both the 4 queens and the 13 hearts.

Let:
- A be the event that a card is a queen.
- B be the event that a card is a heart.
