### 1. Hypothesis Testing

**Null Hypothesis (H0):**
The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no effect or no difference. It represents the default or status quo.

- For our example: The coin is fair, which means the probability of getting heads (p) is 0.5.

**Alternate Hypothesis (H1):**
The alternate hypothesis is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It represents the effect or difference we are testing for.

- For our example: The coin is not fair, which means the probability of getting heads (p) is not 0.5.

### 2. Experiment

Conduct an experiment by tossing the coin a number of times and recording the outcomes. Let's say we toss the coin 100 times and get 60 heads.

### 3. Reject or Accept the Null Hypothesis

**Significance Level (α):**
The significance level is the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis. Commonly used values are 0.05, 0.01, etc. For this example, we use 0.05.


4. **Find the p-value:**
   Using a Z-table or a standard normal distribution calculator, a Z-score of 2 corresponds to a p-value of approximately 0.0455.

5. **Compare the p-value with the significance level (α):**
   - If p-value ≤ α, reject the null hypothesis.
   - If p-value > α, do not reject the null hypothesis.

   Since 0.0455 < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.

### Confidence Interval

A confidence interval gives a range of values for the population parameter and indicates the reliability of the estimate.
