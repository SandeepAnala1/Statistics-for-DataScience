## Population and Sample

**Population(N):** 
A population includes all elements (individuals, items, or data points) that are being studied. It is the complete set of data from which a sample can be drawn. For example, in the context of an election, the population would be all eligible voters in a state or country.

**Sample(n):** 
A sample is a subset of the population that is selected for the actual study. Samples are used because it is often impractical or impossible to collect data from every member of the population. The goal is to select a sample that is representative of the population so that conclusions drawn from the sample can be generalized to the entire population.

### Example: Elections in the States of India

**Population:** 
In the context of state elections in India, the population would be all the eligible voters in that state. This includes everyone who is registered to vote and meets the eligibility criteria set by the Election Commission of India.

**Sample:** 
Reporters and pollsters take samples from this population to predict election outcomes. They do this by selecting a smaller group of voters to survey. The sample should ideally be representative of the population in terms of demographics like age, gender, location, and socio-economic status.

###  **Sampling Methods:**
   - **Simple Random Sampling:** Every member of population(N) has an equal chance of being selected for sample(n).
       - Eg: Every eligible voter has an equal chance of being selected. This is often done using random number generators or random digit dialing.
   - **Stratified Sampling:** Where the population(N) is split into non-overlapping groups(strata)
       - Eg: The population is divided into strata (e.g., age groups, income levels), and random samples are taken from each stratum. This ensures representation from different segments of the population.
   - **Systematic Sampling:** A list of the population is created, and every nth person is selected. 
       - Eg: For example, if every 10th person on a voter list is selected, it ensures a spread across the list.
   - **Cluster Sampling:** 
       - Eg: The population is divided into clusters (e.g., geographical areas), and a random sample of clusters is selected. All individuals in the chosen clusters are then surveyed.
