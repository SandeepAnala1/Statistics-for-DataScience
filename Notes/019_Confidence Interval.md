# T test (When population standard deviation is not given)
The t-test is used when the population standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) is not known, and the sample size is small (typically \( n < 30 \)). Instead of using the z-distribution, the t-distribution is used because it accounts for the extra uncertainty introduced by estimating the population standard deviation from the sample.

### Key Differences Between Z-Test and T-Test:

- **Z-Test:**
  - Used when the population standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) is known.
  - Applicable for large sample sizes (typically \( n \geq 30 \)) due to the Central Limit Theorem.
  - Uses the z-distribution.

- **T-Test:**
  - Used when the population standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) is unknown.
  - Applicable for small sample sizes (typically \( n < 30 \)).
  - Uses the t-distribution, which has heavier tails than the z-distribution to account for the additional uncertainty in estimating the population standard deviation.
