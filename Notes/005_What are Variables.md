# What is a variable?
- A variable is a property that can take on any value
- Eg: Weights & Heights

# Two types of variables
- 1) **Quantitative variables** -> Measured numerically(Eg: Weights & Heights)
- 2) **Qualitative/Categorical Variables** -> Based on some characteristics we can derive some categorical variables (Eg: Gender, Blood groups)

- 1) Discrete Variables: We will specifically have whole numbers(Eg: Bank accounts)
  2) Continous Variables: Any values it can have (Eg: Height & Weight etc)
