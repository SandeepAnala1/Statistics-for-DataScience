# Type 1 and Type 2 Error
- Null Hypothesis (H0) --> Coin is fair
- Alternate Hypothesis (H1) --> Coin is not fair

In hypothesis testing, there are two types of errors that can occur when making a decision about the null hypothesis:

1. **Type I Error (α):**
   - This occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but we mistakenly reject it.
   - In our coin-tossing example, this would mean concluding that the coin is not fair when it actually is fair.
   - The probability of committing a Type I error is equal to the significance level (α). In our example, α = 0.05.

2. **Type II Error (β):**
   - This occurs when the null hypothesis is false, but we fail to reject it.
   - In our coin-tossing example, this would mean concluding that the coin is fair when it is actually not fair.
   - The probability of committing a Type II error is denoted by β.

# One tail and Two Tail Test
### One-Tailed and Two-Tailed Tests

In hypothesis testing, the direction of the test is determined by the research question or hypothesis. There are two types of tests based on the direction of the effect being tested: one-tailed and two-tailed tests.

#### One-Tailed Test

A one-tailed test, also known as a directional test, is used when the research hypothesis predicts the direction of the effect. The critical region for rejecting the null hypothesis is located entirely in one tail of the probability distribution.

**Example:**

**Research Question:** Is a new drug more effective than the current drug?

In this case, we are only interested in whether the new drug is better (not worse), so we use a one-tailed test. If our test statistic falls in the upper tail beyond a critical value, we reject the null hypothesis.

#### Two-Tailed Test

A two-tailed test, also known as a non-directional test, is used when the research hypothesis does not predict the direction of the effect. The critical region for rejecting the null hypothesis is divided into both tails of the probability distribution.

**Example:**

**Research Question:** Does a new teaching method have a different effect on student performance compared to the traditional method?

In this case, we are interested in any difference, whether an increase or decrease, so we use a two-tailed test. If our test statistic falls in either tail beyond the critical values, we reject the null hypothesis.

### Key Differences

1. **Directionality:**
   - **One-Tailed Test:** Tests for the effect in one direction (greater than or less than).
   - **Two-Tailed Test:** Tests for the effect in both directions (different).

2. **Critical Region:**
   - **One-Tailed Test:** Critical region is in one tail of the distribution.
   - **Two-Tailed Test:** Critical region is split between both tails of the distribution.

3. **Significance Level (\( \alpha \)):**
   - **One-Tailed Test:** All of \( \alpha \) is in one tail.
   - **Two-Tailed Test:** \( \alpha \) is split equally between two tails (i.e., \( \alpha/2 \) in each tail).
