### Permutations:
Permutations refer to the arrangement of a set of items in a specific order. The order of arrangement is important in permutations. The number of permutations of \( n \) distinct objects taken \( r \) at a time is denoted by \( P(n, r) \) and is calculated using the formula:

$$ \ P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \ $$

Where \( n! \) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \).

### Combinations:
Combinations refer to the selection of items from a larger pool where the order does not matter. The number of combinations of \( n \) distinct objects taken \( r \) at a time is denoted by \( C(n, r) \) or \( \binom{n}{r} \) and is calculated using the formula:

$$ \ C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \ $$

### Key Differences:
- **Permutations** consider the order of arrangement, whereas **combinations** do not.
- **Permutations** are used when the arrangement or sequence is important, such as in passwords or seating arrangements.
- **Combinations** are used when only the selection matters, such as in choosing a committee or a subset of items.

Both permutations and combinations are fundamental concepts in probability and statistics, useful in various real-life scenarios such as organizing, selecting, and arranging items.
